# Notes for my Final_Project

My final project is a complete weather app using only Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the OpenWeather API.
The app should show:
Current weather for any city searched

5-day forecast

Formatted date and time

Weather icons

Temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit

Key Features:

1. Search Function
   User types a city and clicks "Search"
   â†’ App fetches current weather and forecast.
2. Current Weather Display Show: City name ,Temperature ,Description (e.g., "cloudy") ,Humidity %, wind speed, Weather icon, Date & time (formatted)

3. Forecast Section : 5-day weather preview . Shows: day of week, icon, min & max temp

Used coordinates from current weather to make a second API call using onecall endpoint.

4. Temperature Conversion (C/F)
   Let users click to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
   Store original Celsius temp in a variable:

5. Responsive Design
   Used Flexbox / Grid to make layout look nice on both desktop and mobile.

6. Hosting on Netlify
   Pushed my code to GitHub
   Deploy with Netlify
